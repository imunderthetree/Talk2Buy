## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions:

**1. Search/Scraping Issues**:
```bash
# No search results
- Check internet connection
- Try different search terms
- Verify SerpAPI key if using
```

**2. CUDA/GPU Issues**:
```bash
# CUDA not available
- All components automatically fall back to CPU
- Check GPU drivers if CUDA desired
```

**3. Memory Errors**:
```bash
# Large dataset issues
- Use smaller images for 3D conversion
- Try MiDaS_small model
- Reduce mesh detail for visualization
```

**4. Image Processing Issues**:
```bash
# Editor problems
- Ensure image is loaded first
- Try smaller images for complex operations
- Check file permissions for saving
```

**5. Poor 3D Results**:
```bash
# Quality issues
- Try different ROI selection methods
- Adjust depth scale and smoothing parameters
- Use higher quality input images
- Increase mesh detail level
```

## üìñ Usage Examples
